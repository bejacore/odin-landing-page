# Odin Landing Page Project

This project involves creating a landing page from scratch based on design images and specific guidelines. In this landing page, I demonstrate what I've learned about positioning HTML elements with Flexbox, as all the sections are built using it. Additionally, I am practicing Git by uploading this project and its commits to GitHub!
